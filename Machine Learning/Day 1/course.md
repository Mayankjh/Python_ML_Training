# MACHINE LEARNING

# Types Of ML
* Supervised: which thing or property to use is already with us (labeled data-> related set of output)
* Unsupervised: No field or no specified data. we use algorithms to detect a certain cluster
* Semisupervised : we have both type of data specified(labled) and unspecified(unlabled). It is a mixture of above two.
* Reinforcement Learning :  Self Learning 

# Library

Machine Learining : Sci kit Learn=> data mining, provides machine learning methods, 

Deep Learning : Tensorflow 

# ML VS Dep Learning

* ML : uses algorithms to parse data and make informed decision.

* Deep learning: Deep learning structures in layers to create an AI nurel network that learn and make intelligent decisions

# PANDAS
Tool for ML and data handeling
